            </div><h2 id="the-cricket-principle-how-sound-impacts-cells-in-the-body" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-cricket-principle-how-sound-impacts-cells-in-the-body" class="header-mark"></a>The Cricket Principle: How Sound Impacts Cells in the Body</h2><p>Sound, which includes music, is essentially vibration, molecular compressions in the air that come to your ear or to your skin if you feel it as vibration. The ear has hair cells in the cochlea that translate this vibration into electric signals so that the auditory nerve carries this to the brain. This process involves the synchronization of one rhythmic vibrating object with another, known as entrainment in physics.</p>
<p>The principle of entrainment has been used to create music that affects brain waves, helping people relax, sleep better, and even focus. Interestingly, using a single pitch like 40 hertz has been found to reduce pain and even Alzheimer&rsquo;s symptoms.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-brain-waves-to-issues-of-health" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-importance-of-brain-waves-to-issues-of-health" class="header-mark"></a>The Importance of Brain Waves to Issues of Health</h2><p>Neurons in the brain fire together and wire together to form circuits, and steady brain waves are required for healthy circuit functioning. If brain wave frequencies are not steady, circuits do not work, leading to health issues. Neurons respond most easily at around 40 hertz, which is also the frequency at which healthy circuits function.</p>
<p>For example, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease occurs when parts of the brain that are supposed to initiate and control movement do not connect. Dementia or Alzheimer&rsquo;s occurs when parts of the brain that are supposed to give long-term memory do not connect. In these cases, stimulating cells with sound can help to restore healthy brain circuits.</p>
<h2 id="the-effect-of-40-hertz-stimulation-on-alzheimers-symptoms" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-effect-of-40-hertz-stimulation-on-alzheimers-symptoms" class="header-mark"></a>The Effect of 40 Hertz Stimulation on Alzheimer&rsquo;s Symptoms</h2><p>Research has shown that Alzheimer&rsquo;s results in fewer neurons firing together at the 40 hertz level. Sound stimulation can increase the number of neurons firing at 40 hertz, potentially restoring the circuits responsible for memory formation and retrieval.</p>
<p>In a study, a patient diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s was given 30 minutes of 40 hertz sound stimulation three times a week for four weeks. At the end of the study, the patient&rsquo;s test scores had improved, and they showed signs of being more cognitively engaged and clearer.</p>
<p>In another study with 38 patients, sound stimulation at 40 hertz for 30 minutes a day, five times a week for five weeks, resulted in significant reductions in fibromyalgia symptoms. Fifty-two percent of the patients&rsquo; symptoms improved on average by 40%.</p>
<p>These studies demonstrate that sound stimulation can have a positive impact on health issues related to brain wave synchronization. As further research is conducted, sound stimulation may become a prescription for various health issues, including Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>
