    <a href="#understanding-the-spectrum-of-human-experience" class="header-mark"></a>Understanding the Spectrum of Human Experience</h2><p>Have you ever wondered what it means to be normal or sick? These are questions that have puzzled people for centuries. In this blog post, we will explore the spectrum of human experience and how it relates to involuntary movements, such as those experienced by people with Tourette&rsquo;s syndrome. We will also examine the brain&rsquo;s default state, which is often described as being on autopilot.</p>
<h3 id="tourettes-syndrome-and-involuntary-movements" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#tourettes-syndrome-and-involuntary-movements" class="header-mark"></a>Tourette&rsquo;s Syndrome and Involuntary Movements</h3><p>Tourette&rsquo;s syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by stereotyped movements called tics. These tics are involuntary in the sense that they occur without any conscious attention or intention. People with Tourette&rsquo;s often describe feeling an uncomfortable sensation called a premonitory urge right before a tic happens, particularly when they are trying to resist it. While tics and blinking are not the same neurologically speaking, the experience of premonitory urges is relatable to anyone who has experienced a similar feeling.</p>
<h3 id="the-brains-default-state-autopilot" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-brains-default-state-autopilot" class="header-mark"></a>The Brain&rsquo;s Default State: Autopilot</h3><p>The brain&rsquo;s default state is often compared to a car idling in drive rather than being parked. Some of what we think we choose to do is actually a result of habits and programming. The striatum, a structure in the brain, detects emotional and sensory-motor conditions and triggers the behavior that we have done most often in the past under those same conditions. This is why some people describe their brain as running on autopilot.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the brain&rsquo;s autopilot is not always a bad thing. In fact, it can be very helpful for tasks that we do repeatedly, such as driving or typing. However, when it comes to compulsive behaviors, the brain&rsquo;s autopilot can be a problem. When we engage in behaviors that are coerced by uncomfortable urges we cannot consciously resist, we may be experiencing compulsive behaviors. Miswiring in the striatum has been linked to compulsive behaviors, and it is an area of research that is still being explored.</p>
<p>In conclusion, understanding the spectrum of human experience is essential for understanding involuntary movements, such as those experienced by people with Tourette&rsquo;s syndrome. It is also important to recognize the brain&rsquo;s default state and how it relates to compulsive behaviors. By understanding these concepts, we can work towards a better understanding of the human brain and its complexities.</p>
<h2 id="compulsive-behaviors-and-miswiring-in-the-striatum" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#compulsive-behaviors-and-miswiring-in-the-striatum" class="header-mark"></a>Compulsive Behaviors and Miswiring in the Striatum</h2><p>The striatum is a structure in the brain that is responsible for triggering behaviors that we have done most often in the past under the same conditions. Miswiring in the striatum can lead to compulsive behaviors, which are behaviors that are coerced by uncomfortable urges that cannot be consciously resisted.</p>
<p>Compulsive behaviors can be seen in people with neurological disorders such as Tourette&rsquo;s syndrome, as well as in addiction. Studies have shown that the effects of addictive drugs and the effects of abnormal neurotransmission on involuntary movements and compulsive behaviors all converge in the striatum.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the striatum has also been linked to social neuroscience. Social neurochemistry in the striatum is linked to things like oxytocin, which is the hormone that makes cuddling feel warm and fuzzy. The striatum is also implicated in signaling at opioid receptors.</p>
<p>Loneliness is a significant danger that acts through the brain&rsquo;s reward system to make the state of affairs literally painful. When we don&rsquo;t have enough signaling at opioid receptors, we can feel alone in a room full of people we care about and love. Social isolation acts through receptors for naturally occurring opioids and other social neurotransmitters to leave the striatum in a state where its response to things that signal reward and pleasure is completely over the top. In this state of hypersensitivity, our brains signal deep dissatisfaction. We become restless, irritable, and impulsive.</p>
<p>The areas in the country that are most economically hard-hit, where people feel most desolate about their life&rsquo;s meaning, are also the places where there have been communities most ravaged by opioids. It&rsquo;s possible to rewire and reprogram the autopilot that runs our behaviors on habit in the striatum through neuroplasticity. However, it involves neuroplasticity to learn new things.</p>
<p>Social impulses need to replace drug-cued compulsive behaviors because we need to rebalance neurochemically our social reward system. One possibility is to create and study scalable tools for people to connect with one another over a mutual interest in recovery through psycho-spiritual practices.</p>
<p>In conclusion, compulsive behaviors and miswiring in the striatum are linked to social neuroscience and the danger of social disconnection and loneliness. It&rsquo;s essential to understand the spectrum of human experience and remove the otherness of people who struggle with self-destruction.</p>
<h2 id="the-link-between-social-isolation-and-opioid-addiction" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-link-between-social-isolation-and-opioid-addiction" class="header-mark"></a>The Link Between Social Isolation and Opioid Addiction</h2><p>The opioid crisis and epidemic is out of control, with 91 people dying every day in the United States from overdose. Between 2002 and 2015, the number of deaths from heroin increased by a factor of six. Despite this, the way we treat addiction isn&rsquo;t working, at least not for everyone. Studies show that relapse rates among heroin users exceed 50% within the first week and are about 80% within the first month.</p>
<p>While addiction is a brain-based disease state, how we relate to that disease makes an enormous difference in how we treat people with addictions. Social isolation and disconnection play a significant role in addiction, making it much harder to recover. Social isolation acts through the brain&rsquo;s reward system to make this state of affairs literally painful. Loneliness is very dangerous and increases the risk of early death, even more than chronic excessive alcohol consumption. It also predisposes people to entire spectrums of physical and mental illnesses.</p>
<p>The Link Between Social Isolation and Opioid Addiction suggests that people who tend to avoid relapse tend to be those who have broad reciprocal social relationships, where they can be of service to each other and help. Being of service allows people to connect, and if they can&rsquo;t authentically connect, society increasingly lacks the ability to experience things that are transcendent and beyond ourselves. The hunger created in the brain by loneliness hypersensitizes neurochemically our reward system, and social isolation acts through receptors for naturally occurring opioids and other social neurotransmitters to leave the striatum in a state where its response to things that signal reward and pleasure is completely over the top. In this state of hypersensitivity, our brains signal deep dissatisfaction, making us restless, irritable, and impulsive.</p>
<h2 id="hope-through-neuroplasticity" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#hope-through-neuroplasticity" class="header-mark"></a>Hope through Neuroplasticity</h2><p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to reprogram and rewire itself, allowing us to learn new things. The striatum is our autopilot running our behaviors on habit, and it&rsquo;s possible to rewire and reprogram that autopilot, but it involves neuroplasticity. We need neuronally firing repeated experiences in order for the striatum to undergo that necessary neuroplasticity that allows it to take that &ldquo;Go find heroin&rdquo; autopilot offline.</p>
<p>With the convergence of social neuroscience, addiction, and compulsive spectrum disorders in the striatum, it suggests that it&rsquo;s not simply enough to teach the striatum healthier responses to compulsive urges. We need social impulses to replace drug-cued compulsive behaviors because we need to rebalance neurochemically our social reward system. Unless that happens, we&rsquo;re going to be left in a state of craving, no matter what besides our drug we repeatedly practice doing.</p>
<p>Hope through neuroplasticity comes from the fact that it&rsquo;s possible to rewire our brains to replace destructive, compulsive behaviors with healthy, social connective behaviors. This involves practicing social connective behaviors instead of compulsive behaviors when we&rsquo;re lonely, when we are cued to remember our drug. When we connect around what&rsquo;s broken, we connect as human beings, and we heal ourselves from the compulsive self-destruction that was our response to the pain of disconnection.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-social-connective-behaviors" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-importance-of-social-connective-behaviors" class="header-mark"></a>The Importance of Social Connective Behaviors</h2><p>Social media can&rsquo;t go deep enough for this; it doesn&rsquo;t encourage us to share but rather to compare. Studies show that people actually tend to feel more isolated from social media. The difference between having superficial small talk with someone and an authentic, deeply connected conversation with eye contact is vast. Stigma keeps us separate and keeps us sick, and it often makes it safer for addicts to connect with other addicts</p>
<h2 id="the-limits-of-social-media-in-addressing-addiction" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-limits-of-social-media-in-addressing-addiction" class="header-mark"></a>The Limits of Social Media in Addressing Addiction</h2><p>Social media has become a ubiquitous part of our daily lives. It allows us to connect with friends and family, share our experiences, and even find support for issues we&rsquo;re facing. However, when it comes to addressing addiction, social media may have its limitations.</p>
<p>In the midst of the opioid crisis, many people turn to social media for support and information. There are countless groups and pages dedicated to addiction recovery, and people share their stories and struggles openly. While this can be a helpful tool for some, it&rsquo;s important to recognize the limitations.</p>
<p>One of the main issues with social media is that it often encourages comparison rather than connection. People may see others in recovery who seem to be doing better than them, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and shame. Additionally, social media can be a superficial way of connecting, lacking the depth and authenticity that true human connection provides.</p>
<p>Stigma is another issue that can limit the effectiveness of social media in addressing addiction. Addiction is still often viewed as a moral failing rather than a medical condition, and people who struggle with addiction can be met with judgment and condemnation. This stigma can make it difficult for people to reach out for help and can lead to social isolation.</p>
<p>Removing stigma and connecting as human beings is essential to addressing addiction. When we see addiction as part of the spectrum of human experience, we remove the otherness of people who struggle with addiction. We create a space for connection and healing.</p>
<p>This is where seeking healing together for all struggles with humanness comes into play. When we connect around what&rsquo;s broken, we connect as human beings. We remove the stigma between doctors and patients and caregivers. We put the question of what it means to be normal versus sick back on the spectrum of the human condition.</p>
<p>While social media can play a role in addressing addiction, it&rsquo;s important to recognize its limitations. To truly address addiction and promote healing, we must move beyond superficial connections and remove the stigma that keeps us separate. By connecting as human beings and seeking healing together, we can create a space for true recovery and growth.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#conclusion" class="header-mark"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The opioid crisis has brought attention to the urgent need to address addiction and its underlying causes. As we have seen, addiction is not simply a matter of choice or willpower, but a complex interplay of neurobiology, social factors, and personal experiences. The striatum, a brain structure involved in reward and habit formation, has been implicated in both compulsive behaviors and social connection. Social isolation and loneliness have been linked to addiction, while social connective behaviors may hold the key to recovery.</p>
<p>However, social media and stigma can create barriers to authentic social connection and prevent individuals from seeking help. It is essential to view addiction and mental health struggles as part of the spectrum of human experience, removing the otherness and stigma that can prevent individuals from seeking the help they need. Seeking healing together as human beings, through scalable tools and interventions that promote social connective behaviors, offers hope for addressing addiction and promoting mental health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, by recognizing the limits of current approaches and embracing a more holistic understanding of addiction and the human experience, we can create a more compassionate and effective response to the opioid crisis and other mental health challenges.</p>

            </div><h2 id="the-importance-of-spatial-awareness-in-everyday-life" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-importance-of-spatial-awareness-in-everyday-life" class="header-mark"></a>The importance of spatial awareness in everyday life</h2><p>Spatial awareness is a fundamental skill that is often taken for granted in our daily lives. We rely on it for even the most basic tasks like getting dressed or putting on makeup. It is crucial for maintaining our independence and competence in the world. The ability to maneuver difficult decisions, steer and pilot through daily tasks, are all dependent on our spatial awareness.</p>
<p>However, we often forget that there is a system in our brain dedicated to this function. The right brain system is responsible for determining where our body is in three-dimensional space, and how it interacts with its surroundings. This system is critical in our ability to navigate through the world around us, especially when we are moving.</p>
<p>Spatial neglect is a condition that impairs our spatial awareness, making it challenging to perform even the simplest tasks. It causes an out-of-balance, off-centered performance that can result in functional disability and loss of independence.</p>
<p>The impact of impaired spatial awareness on daily tasks is significant. Simple tasks like putting on makeup or shaving become rune-like, and the left side of our body becomes inaccessible. People with this condition are unaware of their errors, making them dangerous, as they have a higher risk of falling.</p>
<p>The characteristics of spatial neglect include an inability to finish food on their plate, difficulty with the left side, and collision with objects. The cognitive exams of individuals with spatial neglect show a lack of awareness of their condition, making it challenging to address.</p>
<p>In conclusion, spatial awareness is a crucial skill that affects our independence and competence in the world. Impaired spatial awareness can lead to functional disability, making even simple tasks challenging. Understanding the characteristics of spatial neglect is necessary to identify and address the condition.</p>
<h2 id="the-risk-factors-and-consequences-of-spatial-neglect" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-risk-factors-and-consequences-of-spatial-neglect" class="header-mark"></a>The risk factors and consequences of spatial neglect</h2><p>Spatial neglect is a condition that affects many individuals who have suffered from brain injury or stroke. It is estimated that half of people who have a stroke are affected by spatial neglect in the critical weeks and months of recovery. Additionally, about 30% of people who require rehabilitation for traumatic brain injury are affected by this problem.</p>
<p>The consequences of spatial neglect can be severe, impacting not only the individual but also their caregivers. People with spatial neglect have a higher risk of falling and can suffer from injuries that can even be fatal. They may require extended periods of care and supervision, with caregivers spending more than 20 hours a day watching over them.</p>
<p>As a neurologist and a poet, Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor has had a personal fascination with spatial neglect and its impact on individuals. She has been working to understand this condition and its implications for many years, both through her research and her own experiences with patients.</p>
<p>Rehabilitation efforts for spatial neglect have been ongoing, with the goal of improving functional capacity and helping people regain their independence. One of the most promising rehabilitation techniques is the use of prism goggles, which are inexpensive and effective.</p>
<p>Prism adaptation treatment involves the use of wedge prisms that displace what a person sees, stimulating the brain&rsquo;s effortless movement system in the right brain. Therapists can be trained to use these goggles for rehabilitation in about a day, and treatment takes around 10 sessions over two weeks.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that prism adaptation treatment improves functional capacity, helping people with spatial neglect to sit and stand up more straight, use a wheelchair more effectively, and even dress themselves. The treatment has been used successfully in many countries around the world, including Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, and Japan.</p>
<p>Despite the success of this treatment, it is still limited in use in the United States, with only a few high-profile centers offering it. This is due to the slow speed of trust and the reluctance of hospitals and insurers to adopt new paradigms of treatment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, spatial neglect is a serious condition that affects many individuals and their caregivers. Rehabilitation efforts, such as prism adaptation treatment, offer a promising solution to improve functional capacity and help individuals regain their independence. Greater advocacy for these treatments is necessary to ensure they become more widely available and accessible to those in need.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-prism-goggles-for-rehabilitation" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#introduction-to-prism-goggles-for-rehabilitation" class="header-mark"></a>Introduction to prism goggles for rehabilitation</h2><p>Prism goggles are an innovative rehabilitation tool that can help individuals with spatial neglect to regain their independence and improve their functional capacity. Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, a neurologist and poet, has been at the forefront of using these goggles to improve rehabilitation efforts for individuals with spatial neglect.</p>
<p>Prism goggles work by using wedge prisms that are wider on one side than the other. When worn, they displace what a person sees, stimulating the brain&rsquo;s effortless movement system in the right brain. As a result, the individual&rsquo;s vision and movement system start working together to improve their spatial awareness and help them move more accurately.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that prism adaptation treatment using these goggles is highly effective in improving functional capacity for individuals with spatial neglect. More than 500 studies in the laboratory have shown that it helps people sit and stand up more straight, use a wheelchair more effectively, and dress themselves.</p>
<p>Prism adaptation treatment involves wearing the goggles for short periods of time, during which the individual engages in simple tasks such as pointing, marking lines or circles, or even drawing maps. The goggles displace what the person sees, making them make errors in the opposite direction of their neglect. As they continue to make the movement, their vision and movement systems start working together to automatically ramp up leftward actions. After about 10 sessions over two weeks, the brain adapts to the new visual input, and the person&rsquo;s spatial awareness improves significantly.</p>
<p>The success of prism adaptation treatment in the laboratory has been observed in many countries around the world, including Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, and Japan. However, in the United States, only a few high-profile centers have adopted this treatment. This is due to the slow speed of trust and the reluctance of hospitals and insurers to adopt new paradigms of treatment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, prism goggles offer a promising rehabilitation tool for individuals with spatial neglect. The use of these goggles in prism adaptation treatment has been highly successful in the laboratory, and its effectiveness has been observed in many countries around the world. Greater advocacy for these treatments is necessary to ensure they become more widely available and accessible to those in need.</p>
<h2 id="limited-use-of-prism-adaptation-treatment-in-the-us" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#limited-use-of-prism-adaptation-treatment-in-the-us" class="header-mark"></a>Limited use of prism adaptation treatment in the US</h2><p>Prism adaptation treatment is a highly effective rehabilitation tool for individuals with spatial neglect, yet it remains underutilized in the United States. Despite more than 500 studies in the laboratory showing its effectiveness, only a few high-profile centers have adopted this treatment.</p>
<p>The slow speed of trust and the reluctance of hospitals and insurers to adopt new paradigms of treatment are significant factors in the limited use of prism adaptation treatment in the US. However, greater advocacy for these treatments is necessary to ensure they become more widely available and accessible to those in need.</p>
<p>Advocacy efforts can help raise awareness about the effectiveness of these treatments and encourage hospitals and insurers to adopt them. Personal success stories can also play a vital role in advocating for these treatments. For instance, Robert, who received prism adaptation treatment as part of his rehabilitation program, was able to resume his basic level of independence and even drive his car. Another individual mentioned in the video was able to regain his ability to shave and perform daily tasks after receiving treatment.</p>
<p>The success stories of these individuals highlight the importance of adopting prism adaptation treatment as a rehabilitation tool for individuals with spatial neglect. With the support of advocacy efforts and the adoption of new paradigms of treatment, more individuals can benefit from this highly effective treatment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the limited use of prism adaptation treatment in the US is a significant concern. Advocacy efforts are necessary to raise awareness about the effectiveness of these treatments and encourage hospitals and insurers to adopt them. Personal success stories can help illustrate the impact of these treatments and provide hope for individuals with spatial neglect. By working together to promote the adoption of prism adaptation treatment, we can improve the lives of many individuals struggling with spatial neglect.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#conclusion" class="header-mark"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Spatial neglect is a debilitating disorder that affects many individuals recovering from brain injury. The disorder can lead to impaired spatial awareness, making daily tasks like shaving, dressing, and eating challenging. Fortunately, rehabilitation methods like prism adaptation treatment have proven highly effective in improving spatial awareness and allowing individuals to resume their independence.</p>
<p>Despite the success of these treatments, their adoption in the US remains limited. The slow speed of trust and the reluctance of hospitals and insurers to adopt new paradigms of treatment have hindered their widespread use. However, advocacy efforts and personal success stories can help raise awareness and encourage greater adoption of these treatments.</p>
<p>By advocating for these treatments and promoting the adoption of new paradigms of treatment, we can help improve the lives of individuals struggling with spatial neglect. It is essential to recognize the importance of spatial awareness in our everyday lives and ensure that effective rehabilitation methods like prism adaptation treatment are widely available and accessible to those in need.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we must work together to raise awareness, promote adoption, and advocate for the use of effective rehabilitation methods like prism adaptation treatment.
